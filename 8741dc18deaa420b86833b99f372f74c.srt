00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:02.004
- Artificial intelligence systems are

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.008
now finding their way into the workplace.

3
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:07.003
These systems can discover new pharmaceuticals,

4
00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:11.002
recommend products, detect fraud, and much more.

5
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:14.000
This course will give you a high-level overview

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.004
of artificial intelligence concepts and technology.

7
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:20.009
You'll see what it means for systems to be intelligent,

8
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.002
then discover some widely used machine learning algorithms

9
00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:26.005
and artificial neural networks.

10
00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:27.009
Many of those who interact

11
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.009
with these systems will be people just like you,

12
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.009
people in business, entrepreneurs, managers, or students.

13
00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:38.002
Just as managers work with software developers today,

14
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:39.008
these same managers will work

15
00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:43.001
with AI systems and data tomorrow.

16
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.003
So let's see what those machines have been up to

17
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:48.001
in the world of artificial intelligence.
