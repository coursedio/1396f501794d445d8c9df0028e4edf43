00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.006
- Over the last 30 years, machine learning systems

2
00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:06.009
have become the dominant form of artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.001
That's because these systems are exceptionally

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:14.000
well designed to look for patterns in massive data sets.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.005
Machine learning has also been supercharged

6
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:19.009
with the wide availability of digital data.

7
00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.009
If you want to create an AI program to identify dogs,

8
00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.002
you now have access to millions of images.

9
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:27.009
You can feed your network

10
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.002
and help it learn with a large volume of available data.

11
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:34.000
It's the same with other types of data.

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.001
You can easily get digital video, audio, images

13
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:38.003
and documents.

14
00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:41.001
Just a few decades ago, it would've been extremely

15
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:44.008
difficult to get even a few thousand digital images.

16
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:48.007
Now it's trivial to get access to all kinds of data.

17
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:51.002
Remember that machine learning systems feed

18
00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:53.005
on data to learn new things.

19
00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:55.007
The more data you feed into the network,

20
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:59.005
the easier it will be for the machine to identify patterns.

21
00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:01.009
Think about the system that you're using right now.

22
00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:03.009
This is a professional social network

23
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:07.000
that provides video training, users watch the training

24
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.002
through an online video player.

25
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:12.001
That video player collects data about how often

26
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:15.000
you fast forward or how long you watch before

27
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.001
moving on to the next lesson.

28
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:18.008
Now, suppose that the player records

29
00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:21.006
that data for everyone who watches the videos.

30
00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:22.007
That might be hundreds

31
00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:25.008
of thousands of videos and millions of users.

32
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:27.004
So that's a lot of data.

33
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:28.004
No human could look

34
00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:31.003
through all that data and gain any meaning from it.

35
00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:33.000
But machine learning algorithms look

36
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.002
through this data and find patterns.

37
00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:38.007
You can see which content users find more interesting.

38
00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:40.000
This is exactly the type

39
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
of data that many businesses have been looking for.

40
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.004
You can now see real time patterns

41
00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:48.003
in how your customer interacts with your product.

42
00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:51.002
In many ways, this data can tell you a huge amount

43
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:53.005
not just about your customer's interest

44
00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:57.000
but even broader trends in industries.

45
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.007
This data has an enormous amount of value.

46
00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:01.009
You can use it to build new customer products

47
00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.009
or to improve products you already have.

48
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.004
It's no coincidence that companies like Google

49
00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:11.002
and Microsoft are most enthusiastic about AI.

50
00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:13.007
In many ways, their whole business has been built

51
00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:17.009
on using machines to interpret massive data sets.

52
00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:19.005
This type of pattern matching

53
00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:22.005
can be a huge competitive advantage.

54
00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:25.000
Plus, newer artificial neural networks now

55
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.003
allow machines to find patterns in even larger data sets.

56
00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:32.003
When just a few decades ago, these patterns would've been

57
00:02:32.003 --> 00:02:36.000
imperceptible with regular machine learning algorithms.

58
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.009
In fact, one of the largest challenges

59
00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:41.005
around machine learning is that humans don't really know how

60
00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:43.009
the machine identifies these patterns.

61
00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:47.006
It's like a black box of data and processing power.

62
00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:51.009
People simply can't process data at that same level.

63
00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:54.009
So if your organization is starting its own AI program

64
00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:56.004
they should be comfortable with the fact

65
00:02:56.004 --> 00:02:58.007
that the network might be sensing things

66
00:02:58.007 --> 00:03:00.008
that humans aren't able to perceive.

67
00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:03.002
This might not be a challenge with most companies

68
00:03:03.002 --> 00:03:04.008
but might be a real problem

69
00:03:04.008 --> 00:03:07.005
with industries such as insurance and healthcare.

70
00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:09.003
You don't want these systems making decisions

71
00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:10.005
about your customer's health

72
00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:14.002
and safety that humans can't understand.

73
00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:16.004
Artificial intelligence is not the same

74
00:03:16.004 --> 00:03:18.004
as human intelligence, and even though

75
00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:20.004
we might reach the same conclusions,

76
00:03:20.004 --> 00:03:23.006
we're definitely not going through the same process.

77
00:03:23.006 --> 00:03:26.009
Think about the type of data your organization collects.

78
00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.001
Are they using the data for machine learning?

79
00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:33.003
If so, what kind of patterns is the machine identifying

80
00:03:33.003 --> 00:03:34.005
and for what purpose?
