00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
- So, when is a computer system intelligent?

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.004
We've seen that when a computer system

3
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:06.009
is just matching symbols,

4
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.003
it's almost like a high-tech phrase book.

5
00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:11.002
The system might seem intelligent,

6
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:14.007
but it's actually just like a parrot with a great memory.

7
00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:16.002
The philosopher John Searle

8
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.002
said that you can think of artificial intelligence

9
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:19.005
in two ways.

10
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:22.004
There's strong AI and weak AI.

11
00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:24.001
He thought we were much further away

12
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:27.006
from intelligent systems than most people realize.

13
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.009
Strong AI is when a machine displays all the behavior

14
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.006
you'd expect from a full fledged person.

15
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:35.009
This is usually what you see in science fiction.

16
00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:38.003
These are artificial beings that have emotions,

17
00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:39.004
a sense of humor,

18
00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:42.000
and even have a sense of purpose.

19
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.007
That's why C-3PO is scared when they land on Tatooine.

20
00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:47.003
It's also why Commander Data

21
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:50.007
shows real creativity when battling the Romulus.

22
00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:52.008
On the flip side, there's weak AI.

23
00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:54.009
A personal assistant like Apple Siri

24
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:57.002
is a good example of weak AI.

25
00:00:57.002 --> 00:01:01.000
This is AI that's confined to a very narrow task.

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.008
It's like when a system processes language into text

27
00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:07.002
or when it sorts all the pictures on your computer.

28
00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:09.000
Most AI experts believe

29
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.003
that we're just starting down the path of weak AI.

30
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:13.007
Think about Siri.

31
00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:16.002
You can talk to Siri and ask questions.

32
00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:17.007
Siri listens to your input

33
00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:19.002
and then converts your language

34
00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:21.007
into something that the computer recognizes.

35
00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:25.008
Then, Siri matches a response to what's in her database.

36
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:28.002
Most of the energy right now in AI

37
00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:31.002
is around developing and expanding weak AI.

38
00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:35.001
Strong AI is still very much just science fiction.

39
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:36.009
In the 1970s and '80s,

40
00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.004
symbolic systems were used

41
00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:41.002
to create weak artificial intelligence.

42
00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:44.004
These were commonly called expert systems.

43
00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:45.002
In these systems,

44
00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:47.002
you have experts create a list of steps

45
00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:49.002
to solve a complex problem.

46
00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:50.007
If the list is long enough,

47
00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:53.002
it starts to seem like intelligence.

48
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:54.001
But again, this system

49
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:58.005
is just parroting back program responses created by experts.

50
00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:02.000
These expert systems were often used in medicine.

51
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.002
A nurse might input symptoms into a computer.

52
00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:06.007
If the patient has a cough,

53
00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:08.005
then check if they have a temperature.

54
00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:10.001
If they have a cough and a temperature,

55
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:12.001
then check to see if they're dehydrated.

56
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:14.007
If they have a cough, a temperature, and are dehydrated,

57
00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:17.007
then ask the nurse to check for bronchitis.

58
00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:18.007
To a patient,

59
00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:20.005
it might look like they're being diagnosed

60
00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:22.004
by an intelligent computer.

61
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:24.004
In reality, the program is just matching

62
00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:25.008
the symbols and patterns

63
00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:28.009
that an expert created to reach a diagnosis.

64
00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:32.008
Just like the phrase book in the Chinese Room experiment.

65
00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:35.006
In the end, expert systems ran into the same problem

66
00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:37.009
as any other symbolic system.

67
00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:40.007
They would lead to explosions of combinations.

68
00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:43.002
There were just too many patterns to match.

69
00:02:43.002 --> 00:02:46.002
Think about all the different questions a doctor might ask

70
00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:48.003
to reach a diagnosis.

71
00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:49.009
Yet, the symbolic systems approach

72
00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.008
was a key starting point for artificial intelligence.

73
00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:54.003
It's still used today.

74
00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:57.000
In fact, many experts still refer to it

75
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.007
as GOFAI, or good old-fashioned AI.
