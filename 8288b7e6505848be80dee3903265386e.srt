00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.008
- I once worked for a company that sold vehicles online.

2
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:06.006
Each time they sent a customer to an auto dealership

3
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.002
the company earned a referral fee.

4
00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:12.001
For them, it was always about looking at trends

5
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:13.008
in auto sales.

6
00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:16.000
People were much more likely to buy convertibles

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.009
and sports cars in the spring and summer.

8
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.000
Others were more likely to buy trucks

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.007
and SUVs in the fall and winter.

10
00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:25.008
So when customers visited the website

11
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:29.009
they had seasonal promotions for what people wanted to buy.

12
00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.000
One of the tools they used was regression analysis.

13
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.006
Regression analysis is a supervised machine

14
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:36.008
learning algorithm.

15
00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:38.001
It looks at the relationship

16
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:40.007
between predictors and the outcome.

17
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:43.007
Sometimes you'll hear predictors called input variables,

18
00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:47.005
independent variables, or even regressors.

19
00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.009
Regression analysis is a supervised

20
00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:51.008
machine learning algorithm.

21
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:53.005
You're taking the training data

22
00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:55.008
and labeling the correct output.

23
00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:59.006
Then you're using the labeled data with the test data.

24
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:02.009
The best way to think about regression is to imagine trends.

25
00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:04.003
As the weather gets warmer

26
00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:06.003
people are more likely to buy convertibles.

27
00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:07.008
As the weather gets cooler

28
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:10.008
people are more likely to buy trucks and SUVs.

29
00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:13.001
Regression analysis doesn't tell you why

30
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:14.006
people do these things.

31
00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:16.001
This is for data scientists

32
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:18.002
and business analysts to figure out.

33
00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:21.002
It just tells you that these things are happening.

34
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:23.007
Machine learning regression algorithms

35
00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:25.004
work in a similar way.

36
00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:28.006
Once you have your training data, you make a prediction

37
00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:31.005
then see how close you are to the outcome.

38
00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:33.005
Then you repeat over and over again

39
00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:37.002
until the system makes the most accurate prediction.

40
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:39.004
In this case, the data science team thought

41
00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:42.005
that the change of seasons would be a great predictor

42
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:44.004
for the sale of some vehicles.

43
00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:47.001
So they put the months as a predictor.

44
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:50.007
Then they mapped that against the sales of certain vehicles.

45
00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:51.009
With this training data,

46
00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.000
they created a simple X and Y axis diagram.

47
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Remember that this is the simple chart that you learned

48
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.007
from geometry.

49
00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:01.005
Along the Y or bottom axis

50
00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:03.005
they listed the names of the month,

51
00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:06.003
and along the X or top axis,

52
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:09.002
they put the sales by vehicle type.

53
00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:11.007
Then they looked at the trend line.

54
00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:14.002
Convertibles and sports car sales would go up

55
00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:15.009
in May, June, and July.

56
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:18.005
Then those sales would go down in September, October

57
00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:19.004
and November.

58
00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:23.001
For trucks and SUVs, it was the opposite.

59
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:25.002
The more data you have available, the easier it is to

60
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:27.005
make an accurate trend line.

61
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:30.007
As you can imagine, regression can be enormously powerful

62
00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:32.001
for organizations.

63
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:33.009
You can make the product available

64
00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.006
just as the customer's interested in buying.

65
00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:39.002
That's why large retailers like Walmart famously

66
00:02:39.002 --> 00:02:40.006
stock their shelves with items

67
00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:43.007
just as their customers taste change.

68
00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:45.008
People buy more Pop-Tarts in the summer

69
00:02:45.008 --> 00:02:48.006
and they buy more milk and cheese in the winter.

70
00:02:48.006 --> 00:02:50.005
They want to make sure that the shelves are filled

71
00:02:50.005 --> 00:02:54.009
with these items based on predicted buying trends.

72
00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.001
One interesting thing about regression analysis

73
00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:58.009
is that there's some question about whether

74
00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:00.006
it's true machine learning.

75
00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:01.005
That makes sense

76
00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:04.004
because the system isn't learning anything new.

77
00:03:04.004 --> 00:03:07.007
It's less about learning and more about predicting.

78
00:03:07.007 --> 00:03:10.002
Either way, regression is a very popular way

79
00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:13.000
for businesses to predict future behavior.

80
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.009
And these trends are everywhere.

81
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:17.007
If you're missing them, you're not learning from them.

82
00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:18.007
So take a moment to think

83
00:03:18.007 --> 00:03:21.004
about where regression analysis might find trends

84
00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:22.007
in your business.

85
00:03:22.007 --> 00:03:24.006
What you learn might surprise you.
