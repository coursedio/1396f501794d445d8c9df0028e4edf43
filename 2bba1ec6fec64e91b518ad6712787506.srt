00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.007
- Another common machine learning algorithm

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:04.005
is K-means clustering.

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:07.001
K-means clustering is an unsupervised

4
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:08.006
machine learning algorithm.

5
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:10.005
It's used to create clusters

6
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:13.007
based on what your machine sees in the data.

7
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:16.005
Let's go back to the animal shelter in Chicago.

8
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.009
The shelter used to have a large social room

9
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.005
where the dogs got together, sniffed and played.

10
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.003
The dogs had their group of friends

11
00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:26.007
and they played and hung out together.

12
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:28.008
Each time they had a social hour,

13
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:32.004
they would self-organize into these social groups.

14
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:34.000
Now imagine that the shelter was closing

15
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and all the dogs were going to be distributed

16
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.001
to three different shelters.

17
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:39.009
To make it easier for the dogs,

18
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:42.008
the organizers decided to cluster the dogs

19
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:44.008
based on their friend groups.

20
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:48.003
So the shelter created three clusters.

21
00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:51.008
That means the K in K-means equaled three,

22
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:53.008
because they wanted to divide the groups

23
00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:55.009
into three clusters.

24
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:59.000
To start, the machine put a red, yellow or blue

25
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.007
colored collar on three random dogs.

26
00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:05.003
Each color represented a potential cluster

27
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:07.005
based on their social group.

28
00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:10.008
These would be your three centroid dogs.

29
00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:12.004
Each of the centroid dogs

30
00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:15.001
would look at the mean or average distance

31
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:18.006
between itself and all of the surrounding dogs.

32
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:21.000
Then the machine would put the same colored collar

33
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.002
on the dogs that were closest to a centroid.

34
00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:27.000
Since these centroid dogs were selected randomly

35
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.002
there was a pretty good chance

36
00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:31.004
that they wouldn't really have any good clusters.

37
00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:34.006
Maybe all three centroid dogs were in the same social group.

38
00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:37.007
If that happened, then most of the dogs would be far away

39
00:01:37.007 --> 00:01:39.009
from their nearest centroid,

40
00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.007
so it would redistribute collars

41
00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:45.003
until the algorithm could find a good centroid dog.

42
00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:47.004
The machine would try over and over again

43
00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:49.006
until it picked the best centroid

44
00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:52.004
and it might even do this one cluster at a time.

45
00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:54.003
At the end of each iteration,

46
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:56.008
the machine learning algorithm checked the variance

47
00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:59.007
between each dog and the centroid.

48
00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:01.003
Once there was a good centroid,

49
00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:03.004
then it would put the same color collars

50
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:06.009
on the friends of the dogs in each cluster.

51
00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.000
Now, keep in mind that the dogs themselves

52
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.001
did not cluster into three groups.

53
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:13.007
There might be seven or eight different social groups

54
00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:15.008
but there were only three shelters,

55
00:02:15.008 --> 00:02:19.000
so the algorithm had to do its best to cluster the dogs'

56
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
natural social grouping.

57
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.008
The algorithm also had to consider very social dogs

58
00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:25.006
that jump from group to group.

59
00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:27.005
If the dogs were moving around too much,

60
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:30.004
then it'd be difficult to form real clusters.

61
00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:32.000
Another challenge with k-means

62
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.008
is it can be very sensitive to outliers.

63
00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:37.009
So if you had a dog that wasn't hanging out with other dogs

64
00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:39.006
it would still have to be clustered

65
00:02:39.006 --> 00:02:41.006
into one of these three groups.

66
00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:45.003
Essentially, the dog would be forced to find friends.

67
00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:47.003
Organizing dogs into three clusters

68
00:02:47.003 --> 00:02:49.008
for three different shelters is probably not a problem

69
00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:51.003
you'll run into every day.

70
00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:53.001
But K-means clustering is one of the most

71
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:55.008
popular machine learning algorithms.

72
00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.007
One of the more interesting applications

73
00:02:57.007 --> 00:02:59.009
is when retailers use clustering to decide

74
00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:01.005
who gets promotions.

75
00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:03.007
They might have the system create three clusters

76
00:03:03.007 --> 00:03:06.009
to find loyal customers, regular customers

77
00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:08.008
and lowest price shoppers.

78
00:03:08.008 --> 00:03:11.007
Then they'll create strategies to elevate regular customers

79
00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:13.004
into loyal customers.

80
00:03:13.004 --> 00:03:15.006
Many organizations are looking for better ways

81
00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:17.007
to cluster together their customers.

82
00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:19.006
If they can get all of their loyal customers

83
00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:20.008
into one cluster,

84
00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:23.003
then they can really improve their business.

85
00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:25.003
K-means clustering is a good way for the system

86
00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:27.003
to cluster people or things

87
00:03:27.003 --> 00:03:30.003
by looking at hundreds of different variables.
