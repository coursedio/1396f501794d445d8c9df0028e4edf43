00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.005
- Online music is close to a $30 billion industry.

2
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:07.006
And if you think about it, it's kind of a strange business.

3
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:09.007
A lot of times you can buy the same songs

4
00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:13.002
from Apple Music, Spotify, or Tidal.

5
00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:15.001
So why would you want to sign up for one service

6
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:16.004
over the other?

7
00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:18.008
For most people, this has to do with the power

8
00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:21.001
of their recommendation system.

9
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:22.005
A lot of these systems started off

10
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:25.000
by using unsupervised machine learning.

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.007
They would recommend songs the same ways

12
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:29.000
that online retailers would say things

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.002
were frequently bought together.

14
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:32.008
But the best music libraries

15
00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:34.009
don't just want you to buy things together,

16
00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:37.007
many of them want you to discover something new.

17
00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:38.005
So for that,

18
00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:41.000
you have to use a different form of machine learning.

19
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.008
This from of machine learning is called

20
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:44.008
Reinforcement Learning.

21
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:46.009
These are machine learning algorithms

22
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:51.000
that use rewards as a way to give the system incentive

23
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.002
to find new patterns.

24
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:54.003
A few years ago,

25
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:56.002
Google used Reinforcement Learning

26
00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:58.004
to teach artificial intelligence systems

27
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:00.003
how to play video games.

28
00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:03.009
Their AI systems beat expert players at Pong, Atari,

29
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.003
and even more modern video games.

30
00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:07.002
But reinforcement learning

31
00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:09.009
can do much more than just play video games.

32
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.004
These systems can improve over time,

33
00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:16.007
by setting a series of goals and rewards.

34
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:17.008
Think of it this way,

35
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:20.009
Spotify Discover Weekly compares your favorite songs

36
00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.009
with a bunch of related songs.

37
00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.007
The machine learning algorithm tracks

38
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:27.000
every time you click and play a song.

39
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.008
It also keeps track of how long you listen.

40
00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:31.008
The data scientists design the algorithms

41
00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:34.007
so that every time you click a related song,

42
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:37.001
it gets a tiny digital reward.

43
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:40.004
It's almost like money for the machine learning system.

44
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:42.002
It gets this reward coin

45
00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:44.005
when you click on the recommended song.

46
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:49.002
Then the longer you listen, the more the reward increases,

47
00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:51.009
so it gets a reward coin for every minute

48
00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.009
that you listen to the song.

49
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.006
These algorithms often use something called Q-Learning.

50
00:01:57.006 --> 00:01:59.009
This type of reinforcement learning helps create

51
00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.003
more sophisticated rewards.

52
00:02:02.003 --> 00:02:05.008
In Q-Learning, there are set environments or states,

53
00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:07.005
there are also possible actions

54
00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:09.009
that can respond to the states.

55
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.004
In Q Learning, you want the machine to improve

56
00:02:12.004 --> 00:02:14.004
the quality of the outcome,

57
00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:17.008
which is represented by the letter Q.

58
00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:20.005
In this case, you'd start with a Q of zero.

59
00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:22.007
Then you'd have the machine learn the actions

60
00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:24.009
that improve its conditions.

61
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:28.005
The state of Q would go up each time you clicked a song.

62
00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:30.002
You can almost think of Q-Learning

63
00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:32.002
like the system's bank account.

64
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:36.001
It can earn a bunch of coins and then see the balance grow.

65
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:37.009
Once the reward system is set up,

66
00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:41.000
it'll look for patterns to try an increase

67
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.002
its Q-Learning bank account.

68
00:02:43.002 --> 00:02:46.002
So if it sees a pattern where people who like one song

69
00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:49.002
might listen to another, it'll exploit that

70
00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:52.008
and make sure to put that song on your Discover Weekly.

71
00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:54.009
Reinforcement learning systems work best

72
00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.001
when your organization wants to do more

73
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:01.001
than just cluster items that are frequently bought together.

74
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:02.005
With Reinforcement Learning,

75
00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:06.005
your organization can build a system that thinks creatively

76
00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:08.004
about what your customer can discover.
