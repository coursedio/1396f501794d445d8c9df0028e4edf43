00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.001
- If you've ever worked as a product manager

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:04.005
or a software developer,

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.003
then you know that applications

4
00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:09.004
need very explicit instructions.

5
00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:12.000
Every time you open Microsoft Windows

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
or open an app on your iPhone,

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.004
you're benefiting from a programmer

8
00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:19.002
coding the input and output.

9
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:21.006
But we've seen that this type of programming

10
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.000
doesn't work well with artificial intelligence.

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.008
There's too many combinations

12
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:29.000
to tie every input to an output.

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.002
In these cases, you need a programming model

14
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:33.005
that allows the machine to learn.

15
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:34.009
You also must give the machine

16
00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:38.004
some ability to respond to feedback.

17
00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:40.001
Imagine you're creating a program

18
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.004
that detects spam messages.

19
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:44.002
These messages are filled with

20
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:47.001
unwanted advertisements or viruses.

21
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:49.007
You could easily program a word filter

22
00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:53.002
that deletes messages with common spam words.

23
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:54.005
If you frequently get messages

24
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:56.002
on entering contests,

25
00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:57.009
you can filter words like,

26
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:00.008
gold, lottery or winner.

27
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:02.001
So you can program that,

28
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:04.002
"If the message contains gold,

29
00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:07.004
then treat the message as spam."

30
00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:08.007
But complex challenges

31
00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:10.002
don't work well when you're limited

32
00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:12.005
to programmed instructions.

33
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:15.009
That's why machine learning switches this around.

34
00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.000
Instead of inputting instructions,

35
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
you're inputting data.

36
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.009
Instead of a program response,

37
00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.002
you let the machine learn

38
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:26.000
from the patterns it identifies.

39
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You can start with supervised machine learning.

40
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.007
Here, you need to split your data

41
00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:34.003
into a training set and a test set.

42
00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:37.004
The training data is a smaller chunk of data

43
00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:39.007
that the machine uses to learn.

44
00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:42.006
The system will use machine learning algorithms.

45
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:45.003
These algorithms rely on statistics.

46
00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:46.002
You'll see a bunch of these

47
00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:49.001
machine learning algorithms later on.

48
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:51.000
These algorithms help the machine

49
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.006
find relationships within the data.

50
00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:55.006
So the machine uses an algorithm that

51
00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:57.002
if the email message contains

52
00:01:57.002 --> 00:02:00.000
the word lucky winner or congratulations,

53
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.002
then it's 50% more likely to be spam.

54
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:05.005
Then once the algorithm is accurate enough,

55
00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:07.004
you can use what the system learn

56
00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:10.004
on a larger test data set.

57
00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:13.000
This test data is usually many times larger

58
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.002
than the data that the machine used to train.

59
00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.009
Let's think about how machine learning

60
00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:20.004
might work with our spam detection program.

61
00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:22.008
We'll set aside 10,000 email messages

62
00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.002
for our training set.

63
00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:26.003
We'll use it to build our model.

64
00:02:26.003 --> 00:02:29.005
This training data has 9,000 regular messages,

65
00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:33.000
and 1000 messages labeled as spam.

66
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.003
We'll also set aside a million messages

67
00:02:35.003 --> 00:02:37.000
for our test data.

68
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.004
This test data is unlabeled.

69
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:41.006
That means that it's unlike our training set,

70
00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:43.005
no one has correctly labeled

71
00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:45.006
any of the messages is spam.

72
00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:46.008
That would be a lot of work

73
00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:48.009
for a million messages.

74
00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.000
Your training data is then used

75
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.005
to let the machine identify the spam messages.

76
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:56.002
Then once the machine learning algorithm

77
00:02:56.002 --> 00:02:57.004
gets close to identifying

78
00:02:57.004 --> 00:02:59.006
the thousand spam messages,

79
00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:03.002
you'll try it on the larger test data set.

80
00:03:03.002 --> 00:03:04.005
Once you're satisfied,

81
00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:08.000
that will be your initial data model.

82
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.006
Now, this machine learning algorithm

83
00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:11.004
only has two options.

84
00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:14.005
Is that a regular message or a spam message?

85
00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:15.009
That's why this is called,

86
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:19.003
a Binary Classification Challenge.

87
00:03:19.003 --> 00:03:21.009
You'll only need to classify your email message

88
00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:23.008
into one or two groups.

89
00:03:23.008 --> 00:03:25.007
This is one of the most common uses

90
00:03:25.007 --> 00:03:27.003
for machine learning.

91
00:03:27.003 --> 00:03:29.000
The key thing to remember is that,

92
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.007
machine learning algorithms use statistics

93
00:03:31.007 --> 00:03:33.006
to find patterns in your data.

94
00:03:33.006 --> 00:03:36.002
Once your machine identifies these patterns,

95
00:03:36.002 --> 00:03:38.000
it can then classify your data

96
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.006
based on what it's learned.
