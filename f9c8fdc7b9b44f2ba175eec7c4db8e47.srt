00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.009
- Classifying your data doesn't fit every challenge.

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.006
For starters, the system won't always have access

3
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.006
to massive amounts of labeled data.

4
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:11.001
So sometimes you want to have the system

5
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:13.008
create its own data clusters.

6
00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:16.008
Clusters are when the machine uses unsupervised learning

7
00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:19.007
to create its own groups of data.

8
00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:21.006
If you've ever bought something online,

9
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:23.001
you might notice that the store will include

10
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.008
something called frequently bought together.

11
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:27.002
Maybe you're buying a computer mouse

12
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:28.009
and it recommends a keyboard.

13
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.007
This is a very powerful feature

14
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:33.001
and it helps customers find what they need

15
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.006
and increases sales for the company.

16
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:39.001
This is an example of a system using unsupervised learning

17
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:40.007
to create clusters

18
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:43.009
based on what it sees in your purchasing history.

19
00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:47.002
The big difference between clustering and classifying

20
00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:50.002
is whether you're working with human-created categories

21
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:53.001
or machine-created groups.

22
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:54.000
In general,

23
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.008
if you're using supervised learning,

24
00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:57.003
you're classifying,

25
00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:59.008
and if you're using unsupervised learning,

26
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:02.002
then you're clustering.

27
00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:03.006
Think of it this way.

28
00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:06.002
Every Halloween, my son goes trick-or-treating.

29
00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:07.008
This is when kids wear costumes

30
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:10.005
and go around the neighborhood to get candy.

31
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:11.009
At the end of the evening,

32
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.006
my son comes home with hundreds of little pieces of candy.

33
00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:16.008
The first thing he wants to do

34
00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:20.006
is classify the candy by what he likes the best.

35
00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:24.003
Now in the past, my son has benefited from my experience.

36
00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:26.009
I've been able to supervise his learning.

37
00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.001
I can help him create output categories for the candy

38
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:32.001
such as chocolate, peanut butter,

39
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:34.001
mints, and gummies.

40
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:36.001
Then he does his best to classify

41
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:37.008
some of the unknown candies

42
00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:39.005
into these categories.

43
00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:43.001
This would be the same as supervise machine learning.

44
00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:44.005
Now, he also has grandparents

45
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:46.004
that live in a different country.

46
00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:47.003
They feel bad

47
00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:49.005
that they can't participate in trick-or-treating.

48
00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:53.002
So each year, they send a bag of Serbian candy.

49
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:54.001
With this bag,

50
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:56.001
we can't use supervised learning

51
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:58.001
because it's unlabeled.

52
00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:00.008
Neither here I have ever seen the candy before

53
00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:03.006
and the wrappers are in Cyrillic.

54
00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:04.006
So in this case,

55
00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:07.003
he does a form of unsupervised learning.

56
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:10.009
He looks at the bag and creates his own clusters.

57
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.009
He does this based on his own study of the data.

58
00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:15.009
He might create a cluster

59
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:18.003
based on the candy size or the color.

60
00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:19.003
In fact, one year,

61
00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:21.009
he created a cluster that I'd never considered.

62
00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.008
It was a small cluster that he called perfume candy

63
00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:28.000
made from roses and orange blossoms.

64
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.007
This is a key part of unsupervised learning.

65
00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:33.001
Like my son, the machine studies the data

66
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:36.004
and then comes up with its own clusters.

67
00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:38.004
One of the biggest advantages of clustering

68
00:02:38.004 --> 00:02:41.006
is that there's a lot more unlabeled data.

69
00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:45.003
There's a lot of candy in the world that I've never seen.

70
00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:48.008
So I'm not going to be able to create these output categories.

71
00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:49.009
There are also many ways

72
00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:51.002
that you might want to use machine learning

73
00:02:51.002 --> 00:02:53.000
to create clusters.

74
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.008
You might want to have your machine learning algorithms

75
00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:56.007
cluster your customers.

76
00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:57.008
Then a human can go through

77
00:02:57.008 --> 00:03:00.001
and see if there's any patterns.

78
00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:03.001
At first glance, these clusters might not seem important.

79
00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:04.008
They may even seem trivial,

80
00:03:04.008 --> 00:03:07.000
but keep in mind that some of the largest companies

81
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.009
are built around creating data clusters.

82
00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:12.007
Companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Twitter

83
00:03:12.007 --> 00:03:14.004
are all using machine learning

84
00:03:14.004 --> 00:03:16.006
to cluster your friends,

85
00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:19.003
your search history, and buying habits.

86
00:03:19.003 --> 00:03:21.000
These systems see patterns

87
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.009
that would be impossible for a human to create.
