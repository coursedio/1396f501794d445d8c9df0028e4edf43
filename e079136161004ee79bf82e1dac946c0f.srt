1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.009
- Machine learning is one

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.009
of the most popular areas in artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.003
That's partly because of the explosion of data

4
00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:09.004
but it's also because of huge advances

5
00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:12.000
in machine learning algorithms.

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.002
Machine learning on its own is just a set of techniques.

7
00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:18.006
It's a way to build systems that learn through data.

8
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.007
They move beyond the early AI systems that needed

9
00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:24.001
to be explicitly programmed.

10
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:27.002
But there isn't one big machine learning program

11
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.003
like Microsoft Office.

12
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:30.007
Instead, you have many different

13
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:32.009
machine learning algorithms.

14
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.005
Most of these algorithms are borrowed from statistics.

15
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:38.001
The key thing to remember is that each

16
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:41.007
of these algorithms are like a chef's kitchen tool.

17
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.001
Spoons are used for stirring

18
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.004
and knives are used for cutting, but sometimes,

19
00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:48.005
chefs can find new creative uses for that tool.

20
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:49.008
Some chefs use the side

21
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:51.008
of their knife to crush a garlic clove

22
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:54.009
or use a spoon to twirl spaghetti.

23
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:55.009
I once worked for a company

24
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:58.000
that was using credit card data to try

25
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.001
and come up with customer promotions.

26
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.001
They started out using supervised machine learning

27
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.004
to classify the customers into two different groups.

28
00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:09.003
Remember, this is called binary classification.

29
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:12.000
The first group of customers used promotions

30
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.004
and the second group never used them.

31
00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:16.000
Then they used machine learning algorithms

32
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.006
to train the system on this binary classification.

33
00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:22.007
Once they classified their customers into these two groups,

34
00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:25.004
they used unsupervised machine learning.

35
00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:27.002
They wanted to see if they could learn something

36
00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:29.007
about their customers who used promotions

37
00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:31.009
so they let the machine create clusters

38
00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.003
of this specific customer.

39
00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:36.003
Remember that unsupervised machine learning

40
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:39.000
lets the system create its own clusters based

41
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.009
on the patterns that it sees in the data.

42
00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.000
It's the same way that my son found clusters

43
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.001
in unknown candy.

44
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:47.008
What they found was that within this group

45
00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:50.006
who used promotions, there was an even smaller group

46
00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:53.007
of customers who always used promotions.

47
00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:56.002
They called them the promotions super users.

48
00:01:56.002 --> 00:01:58.005
Since this company was paid based on the success

49
00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:02.001
of its promotions, this was a great group to know.

50
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:04.005
They found that this group used promotions for products,

51
00:02:04.005 --> 00:02:06.004
services, and restaurants.

52
00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:08.007
Those customers just love saving money,

53
00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:10.004
so the company tweaked the algorithm

54
00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:14.003
to offer more promotions to these promotions super users.

55
00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:18.005
That small change helped boost their overall success rate.

56
00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:21.000
Now, this organization used both supervised

57
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.009
and unsupervised machine learning,

58
00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.006
so you'll have some algorithms

59
00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:28.008
that work best with supervised classifying

60
00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:31.002
and other algorithms that work best

61
00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:34.001
with unsupervised clustering.

62
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:35.007
That's why it's important to see some

63
00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:38.006
of the machine learning algorithms that are available.

64
00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:41.007
Each one has its own strengths and weaknesses.

65
00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:45.002
Some take up more processing power while others are lighter

66
00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:47.001
and less accurate.

67
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:51.003
Each algorithm is primarily used for either supervised

68
00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:54.003
or unsupervised learning, but there are algorithms

69
00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:56.002
that you can use for both.

70
00:02:56.002 --> 00:02:58.008
Like any good chef, the true creativity

71
00:02:58.008 --> 00:03:01.002
is not the tools, the ingredients.

72
00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:03.003
Your data science team might want to mix

73
00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:06.004
and match these algorithms to gain the greatest insights

74
00:03:06.004 --> 00:03:07.008
from your data.

75
00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:10.002
These machine learning algorithms are available

76
00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:13.005
in most of the machine learning software toolkits

77
00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:17.004
so it's here where your data science team can use its skill

78
00:03:17.004 --> 00:03:18.004
and creativity.
