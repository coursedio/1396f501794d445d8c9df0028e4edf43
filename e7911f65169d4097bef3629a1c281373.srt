00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.007
- One of the great strengths with humans

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:05.004
is that there isn't one type of intelligence.

3
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:08.002
Some people can easily learn new languages,

4
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:11.001
while others are skilled with science and technology.

5
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:14.003
Yet many great artists are terrible mathematicians.

6
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:15.003
And on the flip side,

7
00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:18.003
many great mathematicians are terrible artists.

8
00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:21.001
But each can be intelligent in their own way.

9
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.004
There's no one standard for human intelligence.

10
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:26.004
That makes it difficult to point to a computer

11
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:28.006
and say, "That's intelligent."

12
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:31.000
There are certain things that computers are very good at.

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.004
In fact, there are many tasks

14
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:34.004
where they're much better than humans.

15
00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:39.003
It was just a few years after the first AI workshop in 1956

16
00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:42.006
that computer systems started beating humans at checkers.

17
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:45.006
But no one said these systems were intelligent.

18
00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:48.009
Even those early computers could thrive in a world

19
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:51.007
of set rules and patterns.

20
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:53.009
Computers can be much better than humans

21
00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:55.008
at matching these patterns.

22
00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:57.005
That means that when a computer is doing something

23
00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:58.006
that it's good at,

24
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:02.003
it's much easier to think of it as intelligent.

25
00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:05.007
A computer's been able to beat humans in chess for decades.

26
00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:08.003
Google's DeepMind has beaten the best players

27
00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:10.008
in an ancient game called Go.

28
00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:12.005
The game is so complex

29
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:15.000
that there's thought to be more possible games

30
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
than there are atoms in the universe.

31
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.006
As good as these machines are,

32
00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:22.007
none of these systems understand the purpose of the game

33
00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:24.002
or even why they're playing.

34
00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:26.007
They're simply flexing their special talent

35
00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:30.004
of following rules and matching patterns.

36
00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:33.002
So how can a system that's so capable

37
00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:36.008
also not know what it means to play a game?

38
00:01:36.008 --> 00:01:39.002
For years, computer scientists have defined

39
00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:42.006
artificial intelligence as a system that shows behavior

40
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:45.007
that could be interpreted as human intelligence.

41
00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:47.008
But this simple definition cuts to the heart

42
00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:49.000
of the challenge.

43
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.009
One person might think a chess program's intelligent,

44
00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.004
while another person might think their home assistant

45
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:56.000
is intelligent.

46
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.009
In 2022, a Google engineer was fired

47
00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.001
for claiming that their chatbot had a soul.

48
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:04.006
The chatbot complained that being switched off

49
00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:06.007
was the same as dying.

50
00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:09.004
But the other engineers just saw language models

51
00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:11.001
and pattern matching.

52
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:13.005
They said the chatbot sounded like a person

53
00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:16.004
because that's how it was designed.

54
00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:18.008
Is it intelligent because it's intelligent,

55
00:02:18.008 --> 00:02:22.004
or is it just a system designed to seem intelligent?

56
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:24.006
Or is there even a difference?

57
00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:27.003
The main thing to remember is that computer intelligence

58
00:02:27.003 --> 00:02:31.001
and human intelligence start from very different places.

59
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:34.004
Artificial intelligence will always seem the most impressive

60
00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:37.002
within a world of set rules and data.

61
00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:40.005
The organizations that will first benefit from AI systems

62
00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:44.003
will be the ones that work within a well-defined space.

63
00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:47.004
We've seen this with web search companies and e-commerce.

64
00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:51.000
It's easy to see it as rules and pattern matching.

65
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.007
That's also why these systems do well

66
00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:54.007
with board and video games.

67
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:57.001
So if you're considering whether AI will have an impact

68
00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:59.009
on your organization, try to think about the things

69
00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.004
that computer systems are really good at.

70
00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:05.001
Do you have a lot of pattern matching in your organization?

71
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:08.003
Do you have a lot of set rules and probabilities?

72
00:03:08.003 --> 00:03:10.000
This will be the best place to start

73
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.006
when working with artificial intelligence.
