00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.007
- We've seen that artificial intelligence

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:05.001
started with the general problem solver.

3
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:06.006
This system used symbols

4
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.008
to explicitly program a computer's response.

5
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:14.000
Then just a few years after the first AI conference in 1956,

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.005
we saw the beginnings of machine learning.

7
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.002
Here, instead of programming,

8
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:21.007
the system learned by looking at patterns in data.

9
00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:25.005
Now AI systems are integrating themselves in the workplace.

10
00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:27.006
They can tackle complex problems

11
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.003
and can even come up with creative solutions,

12
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:32.005
and this is why it's important to understand

13
00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:34.006
how these systems operate.

14
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:36.008
Most people who interact with AI systems

15
00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:38.006
will not be data scientists,

16
00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:41.005
many of them will be business people and entrepreneurs.

17
00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.001
In fact, there's a pretty good chance in the next few years,

18
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.005
you will be working on an AI project.

19
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:49.005
Just like how managers work with software developers today,

20
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:53.000
these same managers will start to work with AI systems

21
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.008
and data scientists tomorrow.

22
00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:57.000
Don't believe me?

23
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.005
Imagine someone on your team sent a report

24
00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:02.008
on AI that sounds like this,

25
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:06.000
"Managers need to be able to set the right goals,

26
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.005
evaluate results, and give feedback for AI."

27
00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:10.005
Just like any technology,

28
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:14.001
AI needs to be managed effectively to be successful.

29
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.008
Here are a few things to remember about AI.

30
00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:19.000
First, AI systems are only as good

31
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.006
as the data they're given.

32
00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:22.001
This data needs to be accurate

33
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.003
and representative of the real world.

34
00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:26.003
If it's not, then the system will learn

35
00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:29.007
from these inaccuracies and produce inaccurate results.

36
00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:33.005
Second, AI systems learn by trying different things

37
00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:35.006
and seeing which ones work best.

38
00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:38.004
This means that there will be some trial and error.

39
00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:40.007
As a manager, you need to be prepared for this

40
00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:43.007
and have patience while the system is learning.

41
00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:47.007
Finally, AI systems can do things that humans can't.

42
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:50.001
They can process large amounts of data quickly

43
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:53.007
and find patterns that we would never be able to see.

44
00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:57.002
However, they still need supervision and direction.

45
00:01:57.002 --> 00:01:59.000
With these three things in mind,

46
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.005
business people can start thinking

47
00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:03.001
about how they will work with AI systems.

48
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:05.005
They can start thinking about the problems they want to solve

49
00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:09.001
and how they want their systems to solve them.

50
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:13.006
Now, most of what I just said was written by an AI system.

51
00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:15.009
It was written using GPT,

52
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:19.006
or Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3.

53
00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:21.005
This system is commonly used

54
00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:24.000
for natural language generation.

55
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.006
The AI system scanned through millions of articles

56
00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:28.002
on artificial intelligence

57
00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:31.006
and wrote out what I said after a short description.

58
00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:34.008
Then it used a deep learning artificial neural network

59
00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:39.006
to find patterns in articles about business people in AI.

60
00:02:39.006 --> 00:02:42.002
It then just reassembled these common patterns

61
00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:45.002
into a few paragraphs of text.

62
00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:46.008
So now you can think about the ways

63
00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:50.003
that AI systems can help you or your organization.

64
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.004
What type of data are you collecting?

65
00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:54.005
What would you want to know about your customer

66
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:56.009
that might help enhance your business?

67
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.009
Or if you want to work in the field of AI,

68
00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:02.000
then think about what problems you hope to solve.

69
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.002
In the next few years,

70
00:03:03.002 --> 00:03:06.003
these systems will become eerily more human.

71
00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:09.002
The organizations that create the best AI systems

72
00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:10.006
will be the ones that enhance

73
00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:13.005
and not replace human creativity.
