00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.001
- In 1956, computer scientists, Allen Newell

2
00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:06.006
and Herbert A. Simon created a program

3
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.000
they called the general problem solver.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.006
One of the key ideas of the general problem solver

5
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:15.007
was what they called the physical symbol system hypothesis.

6
00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:17.004
They said that symbols were a big part

7
00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:19.003
of how we interact with the world.

8
00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:22.007
When you see a stop sign, you know how to stop for traffic.

9
00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:25.000
When you see the letter A, you know that the word

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.005
will make a certain sound.

11
00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:29.003
When you see a sandwich, you might think of eating.

12
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:31.002
They argued that if you could program a machine

13
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:34.007
to connect these symbols then it would be intelligent.

14
00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:37.000
But not everyone bought into this idea.

15
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.005
If you program a car to stop at a sign,

16
00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:41.009
or if you teach a computer to respond to language,

17
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:45.000
then it doesn't make the system intelligent.

18
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In 1980, the philosopher John Searle explained

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that sometimes systems can seem intelligent,

20
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.008
but they're just mindlessly matching patterns.

21
00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:55.005
To explain, he created what he called

22
00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:57.009
the Chinese room argument.

23
00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:59.007
In the argument, you should imagine yourself

24
00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:02.009
in a windowless room with one mail slot on the door.

25
00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:05.001
You can only use this slot to communicate

26
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:06.008
with the outside world.

27
00:01:06.008 --> 00:01:09.005
In the room, you have a phrase book on a desk and a bunch

28
00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:13.001
of post-it notes with Chinese symbols on the floor.

29
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:15.002
The book shows what response you should use

30
00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:17.007
with the note that comes through the slot.

31
00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:20.009
It says, "If you see this sequence of Chinese symbols,

32
00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.007
then respond with that sequence of Chinese symbols."

33
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:27.005
Now, imagine a speaker writes something in Chinese Mandarin

34
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:29.007
and pushes it through the slot.

35
00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:32.009
You can look at the note and match it with your phrase book.

36
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.009
Then you paste together the Mandarin response

37
00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.009
from the post-it notes on the floor.

38
00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.000
You have no idea what it says in Mandarin.

39
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.007
Instead, you simply go through the process of looking

40
00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:45.006
through the book and matching the sequence of symbols.

41
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:48.004
A native Chinese speaker behind the door might believe

42
00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:50.004
that they're having a conversation.

43
00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:52.005
In fact, they might even assume that the person

44
00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:54.006
in the room is a native speaker.

45
00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:58.004
But Searle argues that this is far from intelligence,

46
00:01:58.004 --> 00:01:59.009
since the person in the room can't speak Mandarin,

47
00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.001
and doesn't have any idea what they're talking about.

48
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:05.007
You can try a similar experiment with your smartphone.

49
00:02:05.007 --> 00:02:09.001
Try asking Siri or Cortana how they feel.

50
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:11.006
They might say they feel fine, but that doesn't mean

51
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:14.002
that they're telling you how they really feel.

52
00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:16.005
They also don't know what you're asking.

53
00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:18.002
They're just matching your question

54
00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:20.001
to a pre-program response,

55
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:22.005
just like the person in the Chinese room.

56
00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:24.009
So Searle argues that matching symbols

57
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.002
is not a true path to intelligence.

58
00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:30.006
That a computer is acting just like the person in the room.

59
00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:32.002
They don't understand the meaning.

60
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:35.005
They're just matching patterns from a phrase book.

61
00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:37.009
Even with these challenges, physical symbol systems

62
00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:41.009
were still the cornerstone of AI for 25 years.

63
00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.007
Yet, in the end, programming all these matching patterns

64
00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:46.005
took up too much time.

65
00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:48.008
It was impossible to match all the symbols

66
00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:52.000
without running into an explosion of combinations.

67
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.009
These combinations would soon fill up

68
00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:56.002
even the largest phrase book.

69
00:02:56.002 --> 00:02:58.007
There were just too many possibilities to match symbols

70
00:02:58.007 --> 00:03:00.005
with their program response.

71
00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:02.008
So many philosophers like John Searle,

72
00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:06.003
argued that the path would never lead to true intelligence.
