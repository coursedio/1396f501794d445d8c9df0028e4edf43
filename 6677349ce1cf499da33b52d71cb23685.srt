00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.008
- Imagine a computer that didn't need to be programmed.

2
00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:06.001
The system could learn the same way you do just

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.002
by observing the world.

4
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:10.004
You've seen that earlier AI systems

5
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:12.003
used a symbolic approach.

6
00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:15.007
The idea was that if the system recognized symbols

7
00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:18.005
then it would start to seem intelligent.

8
00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:19.007
One of the key challenges was

9
00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:23.005
that programmers worked with experts to create the system.

10
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:26.000
That's why they were called expert systems.

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.001
Later, computer scientists gave up

12
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:31.002
on this approach because it created too many combinations.

13
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:32.002
They decided

14
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:35.009
that you couldn't just program intelligence into a system

15
00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:39.003
but maybe you could program a system to become intelligent

16
00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:41.003
through observation.

17
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:44.009
It wouldn't feel, hear or see or taste like a human.

18
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:48.005
Instead, it would learn by sensing data.

19
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:52.000
In 1959, a computer scientist named Arthur Samuel

20
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.002
created a checkers program that could learn

21
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:56.002
by playing against itself.

22
00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:57.003
It played both sides

23
00:00:57.003 --> 00:01:01.002
of the board and taught itself strategy through observation.

24
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:02.005
The more the machine played

25
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:05.003
the more it saw patterns on how to win.

26
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:07.006
Computer scientists didn't program the machine

27
00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:08.009
to play checkers.

28
00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.007
It learned through its own experience.

29
00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:15.001
Arthur Samuel's called this idea machine learning.

30
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.004
This was different from symbolic systems.

31
00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:20.005
No human program the moves and counter moves.

32
00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:22.006
Instead, the system was designed to learn

33
00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:24.004
and improve on its own.

34
00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:27.001
The system would quickly learn new checker strategies

35
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:28.006
and after a short period of time

36
00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:31.005
it consistently beat its programmer.

37
00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:34.004
Machine learning was a breakthrough discovery.

38
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:36.003
There was only one downside.

39
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:39.002
These systems could play games, but in the 1950s

40
00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:42.003
there wasn't that much digital data.

41
00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:46.001
Remember that machine learning uses data as its five senses.

42
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:50.003
So without data, it could only find the simplest patterns

43
00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:51.004
but that all changed.

44
00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:54.001
At the beginning of the 1990s, the explosion

45
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:56.003
of the internet suddenly had everyday people

46
00:01:56.003 --> 00:01:58.006
creating huge amounts of data.

47
00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:00.001
The 1990s was a time

48
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.006
of explosive growth for machine learning systems.

49
00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:05.005
The new data was like water that poured

50
00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:09.009
over the dry fields of artificial intelligence.

51
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.006
At this point, machine learning systems had

52
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:14.009
the fuel they needed to become more intelligent.

53
00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:16.007
So if you wanted to teach the system on how to

54
00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:20.001
identify a cat, you had access to millions

55
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:22.003
of cat pictures online.

56
00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:23.006
Computer scientists began to

57
00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:26.003
create newer machine learning algorithms.

58
00:02:26.003 --> 00:02:28.004
There were even some researchers that started to

59
00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:32.004
create systems that were designed to mimic the human brain.

60
00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:35.001
One of the big advantages of learning through data is

61
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:38.006
that machines could continue to grow with more data.

62
00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:40.005
If the machine finds new patterns

63
00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:43.003
it can adapt to the new information.

64
00:02:43.003 --> 00:02:44.006
But it's important to keep in mind

65
00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:47.004
that you still run into some of the same challenges.

66
00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:49.001
The machine learning system is still just

67
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:51.005
identifying patterns.

68
00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:53.004
Still, in the last few years

69
00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:56.008
machine learning has been the fastest growing area in AI.

70
00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:58.009
As the amount of data increases

71
00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:02.004
This area has even shown more promise.

72
00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:05.008
Organizations are constantly collecting vast amounts

73
00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:06.009
of new data.

74
00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.005
So now the big challenge has become figuring out

75
00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:12.000
what to do with all this information.

76
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.009
In a sense, you have artificial intelligence systems looking

77
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:16.005
through your data

78
00:03:16.005 --> 00:03:19.005
and letting your organization see what it finds.
