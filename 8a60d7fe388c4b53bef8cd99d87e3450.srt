00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.005
- When you think about machine learning

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:05.005
the key is to focus on the term learning.

3
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:08.000
What does it mean for your machine to learn?

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.007
What strategies can you use to learn something new?

5
00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:16.002
How can you take the strategies and apply them to machines?

6
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.005
Imagine you wanted to learn how to play chess.

7
00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:20.007
You could do this a couple of different ways.

8
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.004
You could hire a chess tutor, then they would introduce you

9
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:25.006
to some of the different chess pieces.

10
00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.002
Then they'd show you how to move them around the board.

11
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.009
You could practice by playing against your tutor.

12
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.002
Then they would supervise your moves

13
00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:35.005
and help you when you made a mistake.

14
00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:36.009
If you couldn't find a tutor

15
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.000
you could also go to public parks.

16
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.009
There you'd watch people play.

17
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:42.004
You couldn't ask them questions.

18
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:45.002
You'd just quietly watch and learn.

19
00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:46.008
You'd have to figure out chess just

20
00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:49.001
by watching the games on your own.

21
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:50.007
If you did this long enough

22
00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:53.000
you'd probably understand the game.

23
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.009
You might not know the names of the chess pieces

24
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:56.002
but you'd understand the moves

25
00:00:56.002 --> 00:01:00.002
and strategies after hundreds of hours of observation.

26
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:03.000
These two strategies are very similar

27
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
to how a machine learns.

28
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.007
The system could do something called supervised learning.

29
00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:12.005
Here, a data scientist acts like a tutor for the machine.

30
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:15.005
They show the machine the correct answers and then

31
00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:19.002
let the system train itself to get better at the game.

32
00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:21.009
The system could also do unsupervised learning.

33
00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.007
Here you just have the machine make all the observations

34
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:25.007
on its own.

35
00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:27.008
The system might not know all the different names

36
00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:29.003
and labels, but it'll figure

37
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:32.004
out their way to learn from the data.

38
00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:34.004
As you can imagine, these two approaches have

39
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:36.005
their own strengths and weaknesses.

40
00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:38.000
For supervised learning

41
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.005
the system needs to have a knowledgeable tutor.

42
00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:42.001
There must be someone that knows a lot

43
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.008
about chess that can show the system how to play the game.

44
00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:48.007
With unsupervised learning, the system needs to have access

45
00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:49.009
to a lot of data.

46
00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.006
That's the only way to see the patterns.

47
00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:54.000
The system might not be able to go

48
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.006
to a public park and watch hundreds of people play.

49
00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:00.006
It also depends a little bit on who it watches.

50
00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:03.006
You need it to watch people who are good players.

51
00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:05.009
As you can imagine, these techniques are used

52
00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.001
for much more than just playing chess.

53
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:11.001
Companies use these techniques to get valuable insights

54
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:12.005
about their customer.

55
00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:14.005
With supervised learning, a company

56
00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:17.009
like Amazon might identify a thousand customers

57
00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:20.007
who spend a lot of time shopping on their website.

58
00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:24.002
The company can then label these customers as high spenders.

59
00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:26.008
Then it would have the machine learning system look

60
00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:28.009
through the customer to find patterns that make

61
00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.001
them high spenders.

62
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:33.000
Now, for unsupervised learning

63
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.004
a machine learning system could be given access

64
00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:37.008
to all of Amazon's customer data.

65
00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:41.002
Here, the system might find its own patterns in the data.

66
00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:43.005
Maybe somebody who buys chessboards are much

67
00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:46.008
more likely to buy an expensive kitchen appliance.

68
00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:50.006
Then Amazon could use that data to advertise.

69
00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:53.001
If you use Amazon, you may have noticed that sometimes

70
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:56.001
they advertise products that seem completely unrelated

71
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:57.008
to what you're looking for

72
00:02:57.008 --> 00:03:00.005
but it's still something you're interested in buying.

73
00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:02.007
Both techniques have their own strengths

74
00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:06.007
and yet each one can give you incredibly useful insights.
