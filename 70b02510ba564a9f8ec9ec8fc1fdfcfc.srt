00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
- Today, there are thermostats, doorbells,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.009
and televisions that connect with each other and the world.

3
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.007
And there are smartwatches that check your location

4
00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:12.003
and some even upload medical data.

5
00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:13.007
This new way of connecting

6
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:16.007
is commonly called the internet of things.

7
00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:19.008
Sometimes you'll see it as IoT for short.

8
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.005
IoT devices are objects with sensors

9
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.008
that communicate with the outside world.

10
00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:28.000
They typically upload data through the internet.

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.004
IoT devices are a massive new source of data.

12
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:33.000
They can upload their locations,

13
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
so that means that if you are wearing an IoT device

14
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.007
then these machine learning systems

15
00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:40.005
can see patterns in where you travel.

16
00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:42.007
They can accurately predict where you work,

17
00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:46.000
shop, eat, watch, and who you visit.

18
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.002
Maybe your smartwatch will tell your thermostat

19
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:49.009
when you're on the way home.

20
00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:51.009
IoT also allows these devices

21
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.007
to communicate with each other.

22
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:55.003
They could unlock your doors

23
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:58.005
or have your computer turn on when you sit at your desk.

24
00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:01.008
In some ways, these new devices make it easier

25
00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:05.004
to create data than it is for humans to analyze.

26
00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:09.003
That's why many IoT companies invest heavily in AI.

27
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:13.000
AI not only allows organizations to see new patterns,

28
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.008
it also allows them to quickly react.

29
00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:18.006
IoT devices and artificial intelligence

30
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:20.004
are a powerful combination

31
00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:22.005
that allow companies to create systems

32
00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:25.004
that predict people's behavior.

33
00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:28.004
My family purchased one of the earliest versions

34
00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:31.004
of Amazon's Alexa home assistant.

35
00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:33.006
It was a terrific and simple clock,

36
00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:35.003
but early on my wife noticed

37
00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:37.003
that the Amazon recommendation list

38
00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:39.004
was becoming populated with things

39
00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:41.007
that were part of our conversations.

40
00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:44.001
We once talked about visiting a relative in Rome

41
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:45.004
that a few days later,

42
00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:47.002
a travel guide to Rome popped up

43
00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:49.003
in our Amazon recommended list.

44
00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:51.004
Ring doorbells also collect data

45
00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:53.005
on people who walk in front of your house.

46
00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:57.002
The company can use machine learning for facial recognition.

47
00:01:57.002 --> 00:01:59.000
It can then use your doorbell

48
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.001
to create a vast surveillance network

49
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:03.004
that's sold to police departments.

50
00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:05.002
These departments can use this data

51
00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:07.002
to place people at the scene of a crime

52
00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:09.009
or locate people they're interested in finding.

53
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.000
One area that has a lot of growth is IoT medical devices.

54
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.008
You can now purchase a smartwatch that's as accurate

55
00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:20.004
as your doctor's electrocardiogram or EKG.

56
00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:23.005
They can use the sensors to detect any health issues.

57
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:26.006
Then they can upload that data to their servers.

58
00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:30.000
Companies like Apple look for patterns in EKG data

59
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.009
using machine learning on a neural network.

60
00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.008
Their network can go through millions of participants.

61
00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:38.003
They can use this data to find patterns

62
00:02:38.003 --> 00:02:41.003
to accurately predict any health issues.

63
00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:43.003
It's certainly helpful to have machines find

64
00:02:43.003 --> 00:02:44.008
predictable patterns.

65
00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:46.007
Maybe they'll find that people are more likely

66
00:02:46.007 --> 00:02:49.001
to have health issues on Wednesdays.

67
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:50.002
They can also see patterns

68
00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:52.005
that affect large groups of people.

69
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.008
You could see something like air pollution

70
00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:57.003
and its effect on the city's health.

71
00:02:57.003 --> 00:03:00.004
In many ways, the IoT devices take the strength

72
00:03:00.004 --> 00:03:02.003
of machine learning in the digital world

73
00:03:02.003 --> 00:03:05.003
and put it in the realm of the physical world.

74
00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:07.005
Instead of just seeing what you're doing online,

75
00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:11.002
an IoT device can track your behavior offline.

76
00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:13.009
This has enormous potential for organizations

77
00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:15.007
to sell your products based on

78
00:03:15.007 --> 00:03:17.008
what you need and where you go.
