00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.006
- Machine learning has gotten a big boost

2
00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:04.007
from artificial neural networks.

3
00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:07.006
An artificial neural network is an AI system

4
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:10.006
that mimics the structure of the human brain

5
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:11.004
and it's currently one

6
00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:14.001
of the most popular approaches to machine learning.

7
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:15.004
Think of it this way.

8
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:16.003
When I was a kid,

9
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:19.005
we used to play a game called animal, vegetable, or mineral.

10
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:20.009
The point of the game was simple.

11
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.005
Someone would think of an item.

12
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.004
Then all the other kids would ask questions

13
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:26.000
about what the item was.

14
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.006
We'd ask things like, does it have fur?

15
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.003
Is it bigger than a house?

16
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:31.003
Then in another round,

17
00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:34.005
we'd ask if it's alive, does it make noise?

18
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:36.006
After each round, we would start to zoom in

19
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:38.002
to identify the item.

20
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:40.006
Then at the end, we started making guesses.

21
00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:41.008
Is it a horse?

22
00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:43.001
Is it a cat?

23
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.009
Is it a dog?

24
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:48.007
An artificial neural network uses a very similar approach,

25
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:51.001
except instead of asking questions,

26
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:52.009
the neural network uses hundreds

27
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:57.002
or even millions of numerical dials.

28
00:00:57.002 --> 00:01:01.001
Also, the network makes much more specific guesses.

29
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:04.006
It would say that there's a 64% chance that it's a cat

30
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:07.008
or a 32% chance that it's a dog.

31
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:09.002
To build the network,

32
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:12.003
there's a row of neurons on the left called the input layer.

33
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:13.003
Then there's a row of neurons

34
00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:16.001
on the right called the output layer.

35
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:19.004
All the neurons in between are called the hidden layers.

36
00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:22.005
They're hidden because it's not the input or output.

37
00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:25.005
To start, we'd feed the input layer of the network

38
00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:27.001
a picture of a dog.

39
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.006
We know it's a picture of a dog because we've labeled it

40
00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:32.000
but the neural network doesn't look

41
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.006
at these labels until it makes a guess.

42
00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:37.005
Just like the animal, vegetable, mineral game.

43
00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:39.004
The network would then look at each dot

44
00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:42.006
in the image as it passes through the hidden layers.

45
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:45.002
Then it makes a guess for the output layer.

46
00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:46.005
Let's say for the first guess,

47
00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:49.009
it says there's a 10% chance the image contains a dog.

48
00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.009
Then the network compares its guess

49
00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.009
to the label on the image.

50
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.001
This is called training the neural network.

51
00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:00.007
Then the network goes backwards and adjusts the neuron dials

52
00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:04.000
so they can see patterns in dog photos.

53
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.009
Then it takes another dog image and sees if it gets closer.

54
00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.002
The neural network then tunes itself

55
00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:14.008
by looking at hundreds of thousands of pictures of dogs.

56
00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:17.001
Then it will adjust its own dials

57
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:20.003
until it consistently guesses correctly.

58
00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:21.007
Now, it's important to keep in mind

59
00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:22.009
that the neural network

60
00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.002
isn't seeing the dog the same way you do.

61
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:28.006
It doesn't think about panting, barking, or fur.

62
00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:30.005
Instead, the system only sees the dog

63
00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:34.002
as a recognizable pattern of dots in an image.

64
00:02:34.002 --> 00:02:36.008
When there's dots in a dog-like pattern,

65
00:02:36.008 --> 00:02:39.003
then the system makes a guess.

66
00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:41.000
Now, remember that these neural networks

67
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.001
are still machine learning systems,

68
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:44.006
so the network needs access

69
00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:46.006
to huge amounts of data.

70
00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:50.001
If you don't have hundreds of thousands of pictures of dogs,

71
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:51.000
then there's no way

72
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
for that artificial neural network to learn.

73
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.008
In the end, this is the key benefit

74
00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.006
of an artificial neural network.

75
00:02:57.006 --> 00:03:00.002
It can train itself to understand patterns

76
00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:02.006
and recognize that input when looking

77
00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:04.008
through massive amounts of data.
