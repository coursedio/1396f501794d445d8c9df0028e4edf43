00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.000
- One of the best ways to connect with humans

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.004
is to join us in the physical world.

3
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:08.001
That's why robotics is one of the most interesting areas

4
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:09.009
in artificial intelligence.

5
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.009
Robotics is about having machines work on physical tasks.

6
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.008
This can be lifting heavy objects in manufacturing

7
00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:19.004
or using robots that deliver food.

8
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.002
Robots can even be vehicles,

9
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:24.005
like self-driving cars or subway trains.

10
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:26.006
Inventors have long been fascinated

11
00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:28.006
with finding ways to have machines

12
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.005
behave like living objects.

13
00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:32.006
In the past, robots were just limited

14
00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:35.001
to highly specialized machines.

15
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:38.004
They were used as welding machines in auto manufacturing.

16
00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:39.009
The auto plants near my hometown

17
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:42.008
employed several specialized robots.

18
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.009
Some could lift a car and install parts underneath,

19
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:49.002
but none of them would ever be mistaken as intelligent.

20
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:53.000
As impressive as they were, these robots were very limited

21
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.009
in what they could accomplish.

22
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:56.005
Unless they were programmed,

23
00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:59.001
they couldn't help a coworker open a car door

24
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.002
or start painting the hood.

25
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:04.002
They worked best for repetitive tasks.

26
00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:06.007
Robotics combined with machine learning

27
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:09.000
gives us many more options.

28
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.002
A machine can adapt to its environment

29
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:13.008
and learn new tasks on the job.

30
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:17.000
A basic example of this is self-driving vehicles.

31
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.007
You couldn't program a car to react

32
00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:20.007
to everything it might see on the road.

33
00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:23.007
That's why the newest vehicles are using machine learning

34
00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:25.008
on an artificial neural network.

35
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:29.000
These vehicles are outfitted with complex sensors

36
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.005
that feed data into the network.

37
00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:34.002
It needs to understand all the different roads

38
00:01:34.002 --> 00:01:35.005
a vehicle might encounter.

39
00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:38.003
Then it needs to look at all the different people,

40
00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:40.003
animals, and other vehicles

41
00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:42.009
the car might find on these roads.

42
00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.008
Then the machine looks for patterns in successful driving.

43
00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:48.000
A car must react differently

44
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.008
when a deer is crossing the road

45
00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:53.001
than when it sees a pedestrian walking a dog.

46
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:55.003
That's why you often see self-driving cars

47
00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:57.003
with a human in the driver's seat.

48
00:01:57.003 --> 00:02:00.000
They supervise how the artificial neural network

49
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.003
reacts to the data streaming in from the outside world.

50
00:02:03.003 --> 00:02:05.007
But like any new skill, it takes time

51
00:02:05.007 --> 00:02:08.001
for the machine to collect enough data.

52
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:09.007
In artificial neural networks,

53
00:02:09.007 --> 00:02:12.008
this is often called training the network.

54
00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:14.005
Google famously said that they think

55
00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:17.007
of their self-driving cars not as a robotics problem,

56
00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:19.008
but as a data problem.

57
00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:22.001
It's true that to figure out how to get a car

58
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:24.001
to steer left or right is simple

59
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:26.005
compared to having a car understand

60
00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:28.007
when to turn left or right.

61
00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:31.006
Some robots don't need this level of complexity.

62
00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:35.003
That's why some of them just use good old-fashioned AI.

63
00:02:35.003 --> 00:02:37.000
Remember that this is an AI system

64
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.005
that uses symbolic reasoning instead of machine learning.

65
00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:42.005
You would just try to program the robot

66
00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:44.004
to act intelligently.

67
00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:46.002
This is the difference between a Roomba,

68
00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:48.009
that's just programmed to avoid bumping into walls,

69
00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.004
and a self-driving car that really needs

70
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.005
to understand the roads.

71
00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:56.007
Most robots today are still programmed like a Roomba

72
00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:59.002
and not learning like a self-driving car.

73
00:02:59.002 --> 00:03:01.005
That's because when you're in the physical world,

74
00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:04.008
there's a much higher price to pay if you make a mistake.

75
00:03:04.008 --> 00:03:06.002
So if you wanted to create a robot

76
00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:08.005
that distributes prescription medication,

77
00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:11.004
there's a huge cost to making errors.

78
00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:14.003
That's why many robots take the simpler approach

79
00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:17.002
and still benefit from symbolic systems

80
00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:18.008
and good old-fashioned AI.
