00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.005
- In the old movie, "All the President's Men,"

2
00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:06.001
the top informant of the Nixon scandal

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:09.006
met in a parking lot and said, "Follow the money."

4
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:11.004
Only by following the money

5
00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:13.009
could the reporter find the truth.

6
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.000
Like the reporter,

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.002
machine learning algorithms must follow the data

8
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:21.006
to get to the truth, but that's easier said than done.

9
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.005
In fact, one of the biggest challenges in machine learning

10
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:28.004
is balancing the bias and the variance.

11
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:31.001
Bias is the gap between the predicted value

12
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:33.002
and the actual outcome.

13
00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:34.006
Let's say that you were playing dice

14
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:37.006
and predicted that you would roll five, three times,

15
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:40.002
but you rolled four, three times.

16
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:43.007
Then your prediction would have a high bias.

17
00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:46.008
You were off by one each time.

18
00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:48.009
Variance is when the predicted values

19
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:51.003
are scattered all over the place.

20
00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:52.003
So if you were playing dice

21
00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:54.009
and you predicted that you would roll five, three times,

22
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:58.007
but you actually rolled two, four and six,

23
00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:00.007
then you'd be off by different amounts.

24
00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:03.007
Then your data would be too spread out.

25
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:05.008
Now, it might seem strange to make such a big deal

26
00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:08.001
about how the system was wrong,

27
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.005
but when you're working with machine learning algorithms,

28
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:12.009
these are two separate challenges,

29
00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.007
so the system needs to fix it in different ways.

30
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:18.005
Think about the game of darts.

31
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:19.007
The center of the dart board

32
00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:21.008
is the machine's best prediction.

33
00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:23.008
That means that the little red bullseye in the middle

34
00:01:23.008 --> 00:01:25.006
is the right prediction.

35
00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:27.005
The machine could throw three darts,

36
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:30.004
and each one of them would be consistently wrong.

37
00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:32.007
They'd all land in the upper-right-hand corner

38
00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:34.006
just above the red bullseye.

39
00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:38.005
This is called having a high bias and low variance.

40
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:40.005
The darts are grouped together closely,

41
00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:43.002
but all of them are too far to the right.

42
00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:46.000
The dataset would have a high bias.

43
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.009
That means to make a better prediction

44
00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.003
the machine would just have to pull the group of darts

45
00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:52.008
down and to the left.

46
00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:54.006
Now imagine a different challenge.

47
00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:56.008
The machine throws the darts at the dart board

48
00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:58.004
and they're all over the place.

49
00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:01.004
That means that the data has a wide spread,

50
00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:04.004
so this data would have a high variance.

51
00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:06.000
To make a better prediction,

52
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.005
the machine would want to tighten up the darts

53
00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:10.007
closest to the bullseye.

54
00:02:10.007 --> 00:02:14.002
Ideally, you want the predictions to have a low bias

55
00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:15.006
and a low variance.

56
00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:18.009
That means that all the darts are in the bullseye.

57
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:20.003
But in most cases,

58
00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:23.003
the machine is going to have to fix either a high bias

59
00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:25.003
or a high variance.

60
00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:28.000
In machine learning, this is such a common problem

61
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.002
that it's referred to as the bias-variance trade off.

62
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:34.001
Like any trade off, it means that if the system

63
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:36.000
tries to balance the impact of one,

64
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.008
it has to look at the impact on the other.

65
00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:41.002
So if the machine decreases the variance spread,

66
00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:44.000
it will also have to increase the bias.

67
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
If the machine increases the bias,

68
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.005
it increases the variance spread.

69
00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:51.003
That's why the machine needs to follow the data.

70
00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:53.004
The machine will turn each one of these knobs

71
00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:57.002
to find the best trade off between bias and variance.

72
00:02:57.002 --> 00:03:00.005
That way, it can zero in on the best predictions.
