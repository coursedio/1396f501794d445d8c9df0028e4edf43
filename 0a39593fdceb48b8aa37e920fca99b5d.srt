00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.005
- As humans, we're always trying to do

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:04.000
a better job of communicating,

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.003
so it's no surprise

4
00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:07.007
that we want to communicate with our machines.

5
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:10.007
In many ways, machine-to-machine communication

6
00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:14.000
is much more accurate than human communication.

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.007
Computer networking transmits exact copies

8
00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:19.002
of information at lightning speeds.

9
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:20.006
Humans, on the other hand,

10
00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:23.007
are always struggling to reach greater understanding.

11
00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:26.004
If you can deliver 10% of what you're intending,

12
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:28.008
then you're a master communicator.

13
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:31.002
That means that the machines we rely on

14
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:34.009
must do a better job of communicating in our world.

15
00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:37.003
To achieve this, AI programs do something

16
00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:40.001
called natural language processing.

17
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.003
This is when you interact with the machine

18
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:44.009
using your own natural language.

19
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:47.007
You can talk with the machine in the same way

20
00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:49.009
you talk with other humans.

21
00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:51.004
We're all familiar with communicating

22
00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:53.002
with a search engine like Google.

23
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:56.001
There's a little box and then you type in questions.

24
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:59.006
You can type something like recipe for Belgian waffles.

25
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:00.007
Then the search engine

26
00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:03.009
will match your phrase to popular results.

27
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.006
Now with some smart devices, instead of typing,

28
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:08.009
you could say this in natural language.

29
00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.002
You could use natural language

30
00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:12.000
like could you give me a good recipe

31
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.009
for those big, fluffy waffles?

32
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.002
It's very common for humans

33
00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:18.007
to describe things by their attributes.

34
00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:21.009
In this case, good, big and fluffy.

35
00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.004
To understand the request,

36
00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:26.006
the system uses natural language processing.

37
00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:29.008
The machine needs to understand that good is relative,

38
00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:30.009
so in this case

39
00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.009
the person probably is looking for top recipes.

40
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.002
The machine also must figure out what's a big fluffy waffle?

41
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:41.004
Modern natural language processing uses machine learning

42
00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:43.003
and artificial neural networks.

43
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:45.004
It looks through millions of conversations

44
00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:47.002
to identify patterns.

45
00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:48.007
So if it sees conversations

46
00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:51.007
with the word big, fluffy, and Belgian waffles,

47
00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:55.000
then it knows that there's a pattern between these words.

48
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.003
That's why many companies like Google, Microsoft,

49
00:01:57.003 --> 00:02:01.001
and Apple offer free email, voicemail, or text.

50
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:03.006
It's a way to have their artificial neural networks

51
00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:07.003
look through conversations to better identify patterns.

52
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:08.009
But natural language processing

53
00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.004
isn't just about understanding the words,

54
00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:15.000
it's also understanding the context and meaning.

55
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.001
A few years ago,

56
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:19.006
one of the top Google searches was what is love?

57
00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:22.005
Humans have written on love from the beginning of language,

58
00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:25.003
so there's sure to be plenty of data on the topic.

59
00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:28.004
At the time, Google would give you a long list of results.

60
00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:31.003
Some of them were about biological pairing rituals

61
00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:33.007
and the importance of feeling connected.

62
00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:36.003
This was the kind of response you'd expect from a network

63
00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:39.003
that's just matching keywords in the database.

64
00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:41.007
There was nothing natural or human about it.

65
00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:44.008
It was just matching keywords in the database.

66
00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:47.006
Natural language processing gives the machine the ability

67
00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:50.003
to understand the larger world.

68
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.009
If you're typing in what is love,

69
00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:53.003
then you're probably more interested

70
00:02:53.003 --> 00:02:55.004
in romantic notions of love,

71
00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:57.000
perhaps even some poetry

72
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.003
or insights into what it's like to be in love.

73
00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:02.001
Now with natural language processing,

74
00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:04.006
the Google response is much more thoughtful.

75
00:03:04.006 --> 00:03:08.003
You can see lists of poems in the history of romance,

76
00:03:08.003 --> 00:03:10.000
but natural language processing

77
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.003
is more than just love and waffles.

78
00:03:12.003 --> 00:03:14.001
Communication is at the very core

79
00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:15.006
of what it means to be human.

80
00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:17.009
That's how we organize, empathize,

81
00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:19.008
and understand each other.

82
00:03:19.008 --> 00:03:22.004
Humans would never accept a machine as intelligent

83
00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:25.002
if it wasn't capable of natural communication.
