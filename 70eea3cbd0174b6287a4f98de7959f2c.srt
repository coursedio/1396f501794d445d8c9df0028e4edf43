00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.007
- In this course, you got an overview

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:05.006
of the technology behind artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:08.000
You saw the field started with key concepts,

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.001
such as the general problem solver and symbolic reasoning.

5
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:13.005
Then you saw how machine learning got a slow start,

6
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.005
but then quickly became a dominant field in AI.

7
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.005
You got an overview of machine learning concepts

8
00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:19.006
and technology.

9
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:21.001
You've seen how several different

10
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.006
machine learning algorithms can help learn

11
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:25.004
from massive data sets.

12
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.006
You also saw how artificial neural networks

13
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.009
could be used with machine learning to get deeper insights

14
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.000
and find complex patterns.

15
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.004
Finally, you saw how your network uses back propagation

16
00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:39.009
to learn from its mistakes and improve its accuracy.

17
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:41.003
I hope that throughout the course,

18
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:42.008
you got a sense for how to apply

19
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:46.008
some of these technologies to help solve complex problems.

20
00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:49.002
You should also think about some of the ethical challenges

21
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:50.005
behind AI.

22
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:52.007
Is it okay to have machines make decisions

23
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:56.000
about your health, welfare, and financial credit?

24
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.006
These decisions could come from a black box,

25
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:01.005
where you have no idea what the machine understood.

26
00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:02.009
If you're interested in these issues,

27
00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:05.002
I've also created a Data Ethics series,

28
00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:07.009
which might be a good follow-up to this course.

29
00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.002
As always, please feel free to follow me on LinkedIn.

30
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:12.009
There, you'll see articles and links

31
00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.008
about artificial intelligence, data ethics,

32
00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:17.008
and key business challenges.

33
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:20.001
Thank you for watching this introduction

34
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:21.007
to artificial intelligence.
