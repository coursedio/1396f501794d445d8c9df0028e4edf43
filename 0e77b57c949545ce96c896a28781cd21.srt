1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.002
- As humans, we classify things all the time.

2
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:06.007
We put our Microsoft Word docs into folders.

3
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:08.005
We separate our business contacts

4
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:10.003
from our personal contacts.

5
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:12.008
We list out things alphabetically.

6
00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:14.007
Without these classifications,

7
00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:17.007
we'd have a hard time organizing the data.

8
00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:20.007
Businesses need to organize the data the same way.

9
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:22.008
Airline companies want to classify their customers

10
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:24.004
by frequent flyers.

11
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:27.002
Retailers want to classify their highest spenders.

12
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.008
Search engines want to classify the likelihood

13
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:31.009
you'll buy something online.

14
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.000
Binary classification is one of the most popular

15
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.003
supervised machine learning challenges.

16
00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:40.001
That's because it's simple and it's powerful.

17
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:41.005
With binary classification,

18
00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.000
there are only two possible outcomes.

19
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.006
Is the hotel room going to be booked next week?

20
00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:49.002
Will the stock market go up this afternoon?

21
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:51.009
Is this email message spam?

22
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:56.008
All binary classification uses supervised machine learning.

23
00:00:56.008 --> 00:01:00.001
Remember that supervised learning depends on labeled data.

24
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:01.009
That means that the machine learning system

25
00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:05.004
is trained to classify the two answers.

26
00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:06.009
So to use these systems,

27
00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.009
you need to first create a training data set.

28
00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.000
Credit card fraud detection systems

29
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.005
are one of the most popular ways

30
00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:16.007
to use binary classification.

31
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:18.006
Every time you use your credit card,

32
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:21.006
a machine learning algorithm classifies your transaction

33
00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:25.002
as fraud or not fraud.

34
00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:27.005
Since this is supervised machine learning,

35
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:29.005
the credit card companies had to start out

36
00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:31.008
with tens of thousands of examples

37
00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:34.001
of fraudulent transactions.

38
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:36.006
The data science team would train the system

39
00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:40.008
on how to recognize the patterns in future transactions.

40
00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:43.005
Email providers use supervised machine learning

41
00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:45.007
to classify spam messages.

42
00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:47.006
They start with a labeled training set

43
00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.002
of messages marked as spam.

44
00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:52.005
Once the network processes enough messages,

45
00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:55.005
it'll classify your spam email.

46
00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:58.004
These techniques are inputting massive amounts of data

47
00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:00.006
and then using machine learning algorithms

48
00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:05.000
to classify your data into human-created categories.

49
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.001
Categories like booking data,

50
00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:08.005
fraudulent transactions,

51
00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:10.006
and unwanted email.

52
00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:13.001
A data scientist creates these categories,

53
00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:16.002
and then your AI system classifies the data

54
00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:19.006
that has been trained to recognize.

55
00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:22.000
Now, classification is one of the most popular forms

56
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
of machine learning,

57
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.002
but it also takes a lot of upfront effort

58
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:26.007
to train the system.

59
00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:29.002
It can be a challenge to get tens of thousands

60
00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:31.000
of fraudulent credit card transactions

61
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.005
or tens of thousands of spam email messages.

62
00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:36.002
Plus, there's no guarantee that'll be enough

63
00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:38.009
for the system to make accurate predictions.

64
00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:40.006
That means your data science team

65
00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:41.007
might find itself going back

66
00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:44.006
and getting another 10,000 transactions.

67
00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:47.001
Your team will have to feed the machine learning algorithm

68
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:50.009
until it's extremely accurate at classifying your data.

69
00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:53.006
That's why even now, after several years of development,

70
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:56.008
your credit card company might send you a fraud warning

71
00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:59.007
even though it's not a fraudulent transaction.

72
00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:02.004
Data scientists are constantly training these systems

73
00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:05.003
to make the classifications more accurate.

74
00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:07.006
Credit card fraud, spam detection,

75
00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:09.007
and online purchasing might all seem

76
00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:11.007
like very different challenges,

77
00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:13.005
but to your machine learning system,

78
00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:16.005
they're all just different ways of doing the same thing.

79
00:03:16.005 --> 00:03:18.009
You're classifying your labeled data

80
00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:21.002
into predefined categories.
